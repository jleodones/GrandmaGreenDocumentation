# Grandma Green Documentation ðŸŒ±

Welcome to Grandma Green's documentation! This page was built for old and new dev team members alike to help keep track of changes to the system.

This repository has been configured to sync with changes to the Perforce depot every day at midnight PST. Any updates will then be pushed and published to the website immediately afterwards. Collaborators may also manually sync the repository and/or rebuild the website.

Please contact Jamie Leodones at [leodones@usc.edu](mailto:leodones@usc.edu) for any troubles regarding this repository and its documentation, or to be added as a collaborator. ðŸ’š
